# Link to Video

A replacement for the RF modulator in the original Nintendo Entertainment System (NES-001). Drops into the stock RF module slot inside the shell and provides composite video and USB-C power in place of a part that fails by design.

## Why this board exists

The NES-001's RF modulator already carries composite video, so this isn't about
adding an output the console lacks. It's about replacing a part that reliably
destroys itself.

Nintendo packed the modulator's regulator and RF stages into a sealed can with no
ventilation. It cooks its own electrolytics, they leak, and the electrolyte eats
the traces underneath. Across three NES-001 units on the author's bench, **all
three** had modulator failures from exactly this — including a Mitsumi unit that
looked pristine externally and had every capacitor leaking inside.

So the modulator is a consumable on a forty-year-old console, and the usual
options are to recap a corroded board or to fit an aftermarket board. This is the
second option, with the power input modernised to USB-C while the slot is open.

## Disclosure

This project's schematic design, debugging, and documentation were developed with the assistance of AI (Claude, by Anthropic). All hardware was hand-assembled, tested, and validated by the author. Use, review, and verify independently before building.

## Status

🟡 First prototype assembled and power-tested successfully (5V confirmed clean on rail, no protection trips). Video output path **does not work on v1 hardware** — traced to a schematic defect in which Q1's emitter node was shorted to the +5V rail (see Known Issues). Fixed in source; v1 boards need a rework.

<!-- Swap the line above for something like this once video's confirmed:
🟢 Fully validated — power and composite video both confirmed working on hardware.

## Features

- USB-C power input (power only — no data lines)
- Composite video output
- Active overcurrent protection — TPS2553 eFuse with a ~1.18 A resistor-programmed limit, soft-start and thermal shutdown, backed by a polyfuse
- Fits inside the original NES shell at the stock RF module location
- Bring-up test points for video, ground, +5V and audio, labelled on the silkscreen
- Feed header for an external 8-pin mini-DIN RGB connector (NESRGB)
- All resistor and capacitor values printed on the silkscreen — the v1 board had four identical unlabelled axial footprints carrying four different values, which caused three separate wrong-resistor build errors
- 2-layer PCB, designed in KiCad

## Power path

```
USB-C  ──  F1 polyfuse  ──  U1 TPS2553 eFuse  ──  +5V rail  ──  J4.3 → NES
  VBUS      2.0A hold        ~1.18A limit          C1 100µF
            3.8A trip        soft-start            D1 TVS
            (backup)         thermal shutdown
```

F1 alone trips at 3.8 A, which protects nothing on a console that draws
roughly 0.5–0.7 A. U1 is the real protection; F1 stays as a backup in case
the eFuse ever fails short.

The current limit is set by R6 on U1's ILIM pin. The relationship is
**inverse** — a larger resistor gives a *lower* limit:

| R6 | Limit (typ) |
|---|---|
| 15 kΩ | 1700 mA |
| 20 kΩ | 1295 mA |
| **22 kΩ (fitted)** | **~1180 mA** |
| 49.9 kΩ | 520 mA |
| 210 kΩ | 130 mA |

Roughly I_OS(A) ≈ 25.9 / R6(kΩ), valid over TI's recommended 15 kΩ–232 kΩ.

U1's EN (pin 3) is active-high and tied to its own input, so the switch is
always on. FAULT (pin 4) is an open-drain output left unconnected — there is
nothing inside a closed NES shell to indicate to. If you want fault
indication, it can sink 25 mA directly.

A useful side effect: D1 is a unidirectional TVS, so fitting it backwards
puts a forward-biased diode across the 5 V rail. Before U1 that was a near
short relying on a polyfuse taking seconds to react. Now the eFuse current-
limits it at ~1.18 A and thermally shuts down, so the mistake is
self-limiting rather than destructive.

## Test points (v2)

Four through-hole test points (2.0 mm pad, 1.0 mm drill) for bring-up. They accept
a 0.64 mm square header pin, so you can solder pins in and use scope grabbers.

The silkscreen carries the signal name only — `VIDEO`, `GND`, `+5V`, `AUDIO` — so
the board reads without this table. The refdes lives on F.Fab for the fab drawings.
(On v2's first pass this was backwards: the signal names were on F.Fab, which never
reaches the physical board, so the silkscreen said only `TP1`–`TP4`.)

| TP  | Net          | Location (mm) | Notes |
|-----|--------------|---------------|-------|
| TP1 | `/VIDEO_OUT` | 62.0, 60.0    | Jack-side video, i.e. after C2 and the 75 Ω series R5 — what the TV actually sees. A high-impedance probe reads roughly double the terminated amplitude. |
| TP2 | `GND`        | 58.5, 60.0    | Straight into the B.Cu ground pour. |
| TP3 | `/5V`        | 52.0, 43.1    | Sits directly on the protected 5 V trunk, downstream of F1 and the TPS2553. |
| TP4 | `/AUDIO_OUT` | 65.9, 28.35   | Audio pass-through between J4 pin 2 and J2. |

The whole back layer is a ground pour, so TP2's position is a convenience, not a
constraint — you can clip a ground lead to any B.Cu feature.

To probe the buffer itself rather than its output, use Q1's emitter leg directly;
there is no test point on `Net-(Q1-E)`.

## RGB output (v2)

Provision for the [NESRGB](https://etim.net.au/nesrgb/) board's RGB connector —
the Micomsoft XRGB-mini Framemeister 8-pin mini-DIN standard.

The connector itself is **not** on this board. The NESRGB kit ships it as a
panel-mount jack that epoxies into a 12 mm hole in the shell, so this board just
feeds it. R/G/B run directly from the NESRGB to the connector; we supply the
other three pins on **J5**:

| J5 pin | Net          | mini-DIN pin | |
|--------|--------------|--------------|---|
| 1 | `/RGB_VIDEO` | 3 | Composite video / sync, 75 Ω terminated |
| 2 | `GND`        | 4 | |
| 3 | `/5V`        | 5 | Downstream of the TPS2553, so it is current-limited |

mini-DIN pins 1 and 2 are N/C; pins 6, 7 and 8 are Blue, Green and Red from the
NESRGB. Note the standard carries no audio — that stays on the RCA jack, which is
deliberate on Tim Worthington's part (it keeps video noise out of the audio).

**Why R7 exists.** The video buffer's output (`/VIDEO_BUF`, Q1's emitter through
C2) now feeds two outputs. Each needs its own 75 Ω source termination: R5 for the
RCA jack, R7 for the mini-DIN. Tying both to one resistor would put two 75 Ω loads
in parallel and halve the amplitude whenever both cables are plugged in.

**One output at a time.** Composite and RGB are an either/or — the design does not
target using both at once. Whichever cable is plugged sees a correct 75 Ω source,
and the unused branch is an unloaded stub.

If both are ever plugged in simultaneously, R7 means each still gets a properly
terminated 75 Ω source rather than the halved amplitude you'd get from sharing one
resistor. Q1's drive is the limit in that case, and it is why **R1 is 220 Ω from
v2** rather than the original 330 Ω. Simulated in ngspice with 2 Vpp at the tap
and both outputs terminated: at 330 Ω the follower clips the positive (white)
peaks by 33 %, at 220 Ω by 11 %. With a single output loaded — the supported
mode — 220 Ω is clean and symmetric (+0.439 / −0.447 V at the jack). Simulated,
not measured on hardware, and still not a supported mode.

## Build Notes / Known Issues (v1)

- **Q1 emitter node shorted to +5V (breaks video).** Q1's emitter is clamped to the rail, so C2 couples +5V — not video — into R5/J3. The exact wiring differs by revision: in the repo's pre-v1.1 source R1 had *both* ends on `/5V`, while the fabbed 2026-07-16 boards have R1 pad 1 on `/5V` and pad 2 on a separate net with C1 only. Root cause: an R2 (110Ω) was deleted from the schematic on 2026-07-04, and KiCad merged the two leftover collinear wire stubs into one wire, welding the emitter node to `/5V`. Fixed in source as of v1.1. **Rework for an existing board** (applies to the boards fabbed from the 2026-07-16 gerbers, whose IPC netlist reads `/5V = J4.3, F1.1, R1.1, Q1.1, C2.1, D1.1` and `Net-(C1-Pad1) = R1.2, C1.1`):

That revision has two defects — Q1's emitter is clamped to the rail, *and* C1 only reaches the rail through R1, so the bulk cap decouples nothing. Both are fixed together:

**Confirm the diagnosis before you cut.** Power off, unplugged, caps discharged.
Probe +5 V at J4 pin 3 or D1's K-marked lead. Two measurements, mirror images of
each other:

| Measurement | Defective board | Correctly wired |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 emitter → +5 V | **~0 Ω** | ~330 Ω (R1) |
| C1 **+** terminal → +5 V | **~330 Ω** (stranded behind R1) | ~0 Ω |

After the rework these swap. To identify Q1's legs without relying on the TO-92
orientation: the leg reading 0 Ω to GND is the collector, the leg with continuity
to J4 pin 1 is the base, and the remaining one is the emitter.

Two tests that look useful but are not:

- **Emitter → J3 tip.** C2 blocks DC, so this reads open either way.
- **C1 + → Q1 emitter.** Reads ~330 Ω on a good board *and* a bad one, because R1
  sits between them in both wirings. It cannot distinguish the two.

Powered, the fastest single check is DC at Q1's emitter: roughly 1.5–3 V if
correct, sitting at exactly the rail voltage if shorted.

**R1's left pad is a star point.** Three things meet there: F1 (the source), the
D1 + J4.3 branch (the load), and Q1's emitter. The two incoming rail traces are
*collinear*, so a single cut severs both — which is why this needs **two**
jumpers, not one.

1. **Cut** the 0.8 mm trace leaving R1's left pad toward the **upper left**, about
   5–8 mm from the pad. Leave the trace entering from the upper right — that is
   Q1's emitter and must stay. Stay below the level of D1's cathode; above that
   point only one of the two overlapping traces is present, and you need both cut.

2. **Two jumpers.** The cut leaves three islands that must all become one rail:

   | Island | Pads |
   |---|---|
   | A | C1's **+** pad, R1's **right** pad |
   | B | F1 pad 1 (left pad, trace toward D1 — not the USB-C side) |
   | C | D1's cathode (K), J4 pin 3 |

   Any two wires joining all three work. One wire per pad:
   - **C1+ → F1 pad 1** (~14 mm)
   - **R1's right pad → D1 cathode** (~25 mm)

   Do this with R1 removed — its right pad is far easier to solder empty.

3. **Fit R1 = 300–330 Ω.** Check the part before fitting: R1, R3, R4, R5 (and R7
   on v2) all share the same `R_Axial_DIN0207` footprint in four different values,
   and the v1 silkscreen prints no values. At least one board was built with a
   5.1 kΩ from the R3/R4 pile in R1, which gives ~0.6 mA of standing current
   instead of ~9 mA — enough to look plausible and still produce no usable video.

4. **Confirm R5 (75Ω) is populated.** Across R5's own pads should read ~75 Ω; it
   has no parallel path in circuit (C2 blocks DC on one side, the jack is open on
   the other), so it doubles as a meter sanity check.

5. **Fit the transistor last.** Powering the board before the cut is done drives
   Q1 into saturation from the rail straight to ground with no current limit — see
   below.

Verify with a meter before powering: R1's left pad to D1 cathode must now read
**open**; R1's left pad to F1 pad 1 must read **~330Ω** through R1; R1's left pad
must still show continuity to Q1's emitter and C2 pin 1; and D1's cathode must
read **~0 Ω** to J4 pin 3 *and* to F1 pad 1. Powered, Q1's emitter should sit near
1.5–3V — a reading of 5V means the cut did not take.

**The short destroys transistors.** With the emitter clamped to +5 V and the base
at the NES's video level, the B-E junction is forward-biased by 3–4 V, so Q1
saturates with its collector tied directly to ground and nothing limiting the
current. Q1 is a 150 mA part; F1 does not trip until 3.8 A. Every power-up in that
state risks another transistor, which is the likely fate of the first one.
- F1 (polyfuse) footprint field in KiCad is mislabeled as a polarized capacitor footprint despite correct value — cosmetic/documentation issue only, does not affect function. Fix planned for v2.
- Video/audio RCA jack mounting holes are slightly asymmetric — cosmetic only, doesn't affect NES shell fit.
- v1 silkscreen doesn't include component value labels or Q1 pin markers (E/C/B). **Values are on the silkscreen from v2.** On v1 this caused three separate wrong-resistor errors in R1 (a 5.1kΩ and an 820Ω both fitted before the right value went in) because R1/R3/R4/R5/R7 share one footprint across four values. Q1 pin markers are still outstanding.
- **VBUS input trace is undersized for its own fuse (all fabbed boards).** `/raw_5v`
  reaches F1 through 9.06 mm of 0.2 mm trace. It exceeds FR4's glass transition at
  2.22 A and chars at 2.83 A, while F1 (RHEF200) is guaranteed not to trip below 2.0 A
  and only guaranteed to trip above 3.8 A — so there is a 2.2–3.8 A window where the
  trace is destroyed and the fuse may never act. Root cause was a netclass pattern gap:
  the `Power` class (0.8 mm) was assigned by the patterns `/5V*`, `GND*`, `VBUS`, none
  of which match the net's actual name `/raw_5v`, so it fell through to `Default`
  (0.2 mm). DRC cannot catch this — it enforces the board `min_track_width` (0.2 mm),
  not the netclass width. Fixed in `247334c` by correcting the pattern and rerouting to
  0.8 mm. **Existing boards need a rework** — see
  [the safety advisory](docs/SAFETY-ADVISORY-2026-09-vbus-trace-ampacity.md).

- **D1 does not protect U1.** The fitted TVS is a Littelfuse 1.5KE6.8A: stand-off 5.80 V, breakdown 6.45–7.14 V at 10 mA, clamping 10.5 V at 144.8 A. The TPS2553's absolute maximum on IN and OUT is 7 V, so the TVS has barely begun conducting by the time the eFuse is already out of spec, and under a real surge it lets the rail reach 10.5 V. D1 protects the console downstream; it will not save U1. Repositioning D1 doesn't help — both U1 pins share the same 7 V rating — and no avalanche TVS clamps below 7 V while standing off USB-C's 5.5 V worst case. Proper protection needs a switch with integrated overvoltage cutoff. Deferred to v3 — v2 ships with this gap.
- D1's symbol (`Diode:1.5KExxA`) names both pins A1/A2 and draws no cathode — KiCad uses identical pin naming for the unidirectional and bidirectional variants of this part. Polarity comes only from the footprint silkscreen band, which is at the pad-1 (+5 V) end and is correct. Watch this when hand-assembling.

## Video input biasing

Q1's base is DC-coupled straight to the NES video line, with no bias network on
this board. That is deliberate, and it took a long bench session to establish
why it works.

**The NES mainboard supplies a 1 kΩ pulldown on its video output pin.** Measured
in circuit at 0.999 kΩ, identical with the meter leads both ways — a real
resistor, not a semiconductor junction. Q1's base sources roughly 46 µA, which
that 1 kΩ absorbs in about 46 mV. The base cannot float up and Q1 cannot cut off.

This is the same reason Nintendo's own modulator has no base pulldown either. It
also matches the load Nintendo presented on that pin: a 330 Ω series resistor
into a 5.6 kΩ / 330 Ω divider, roughly 500 Ω in total. The NES is built to drive
a few hundred ohms.

**So no base pulldown, and no input coupling cap.** If you are adapting this
design to something other than an NES-001, measure that pin to ground first —
if it reads open, you need a pulldown (~47 kΩ) and this board does not have one.

**R2 (330 Ω) is not a bias resistor.** It sits in series between J4 pin 1 and
Q1's base, mirroring the 330 Ω Nintendo places in the same position. Against
Q1's ~21 kΩ base input impedance it costs nothing in signal terms; what it buys
is fault-current limiting into the base-emitter junction, whose reverse rating
is only 5 V.

## Design checks

Three safety nets sit alongside ERC and DRC, the first two aimed at faults this
board has actually shipped with, the third at the gap between checking a board
and fabricating it.

### `tools/check_nets.py`

```
python3 tools/check_nets.py
```

Exports the schematic netlist, reads the PCB's pad nets, confirms the two agree,
and asserts a set of invariants — chief among them that **Q1's emitter is not on
any power net**. That was the v1 fault: the emitter follower's output was tied
to +5V along with J4.3, D1.1 and F1.1, so Q1 saturated into a grounded collector
with nothing limiting the current. It destroyed a transistor on every power-up.

**ERC and DRC both passed cleanly on that board.** Neither can see that a net is
*wrong*, only that it is internally consistent — which is exactly why this check
exists. Run it before generating a fab package. Gerbers carry no net information,
so once you have them the mistake is invisible.

### `nes_power_video.kicad_dru`

Custom DRC rules covering the geometric half: extra clearance between Q1's
emitter and base nodes and the supply rails, and between the two USB-C
configuration channels. These catch the layout-adjacency version of the same
mistakes. They cannot catch a wrong net assignment — DRC has no view of design
intent — which is what the script above is for.

### `prefab-gate`

```
export KICAD_CLI=/Applications/KiCad/KiCad.app/Contents/MacOS/kicad-cli
prefab_gate package nes_power_video.kicad_pcb --out pcbway_production
```

**prefab-gate now lives in its own repository:
[danielboston38/prefab-gate](https://github.com/danielboston38/prefab-gate).** It
is a general-purpose KiCad tool with its own audience and its own MIT licence,
so it no longer ships inside a hardware project. Install it as a KiCad plugin
through the Plugin and Content Manager, as a Claude Code plugin
(`/plugin marketplace add danielboston38/prefab-gate`), or clone it and run
`scripts/prefab_gate.py` directly.

The gate refuses to write a fab package from a board that has not passed DRC
with zone refill *and* schematic parity. It hashes
the board and schematic after the refill and re-checks them before publishing, so
the package always describes the board that was actually verified — recorded in
`manifest.json` alongside every finding, including the cosmetic ones it waived.

Run `check` instead of `package` to get the verdict without writing files.

`pcbway_production/` is not tracked — packages are reproducible from the board,
and the two that were actually fabbed remain in git history at the 2026-07-07
and 2026-07-16 commits. Generate a fresh one when you order rather than reaching
for an old directory, so the gate re-verifies the board you are about to pay for.

## Assembly

<!-- Add step-by-step or reference photos here once you've got a documented build process -->

Refer to BOM.csv for exact part values and footprints. Every component carries
its sourcing data in two places, kept in step: the `Manufacturer`, `MPN`,
`LCSC`, `Supplier Link` and `Datasheet` fields on the schematic symbol, and
the matching columns in `BOM.csv`. Jellybean passives have no manufacturer
part number by design — they carry a `Spec` field instead (tolerance, rating,
package) and any part meeting it will do. To pull the fields straight out of
the schematic:

```
kicad-cli sch export bom --group-by '' \
    --fields 'Reference,Value,Manufacturer,MPN,LCSC,Datasheet,Supplier Link,Spec' \
    -o bom.csv nes_power_video.kicad_sch
```

`BOM.csv`'s `Mount` column marks each line `SMD` or `THT`, taken from the
footprint's own attributes on the board.

### Having PCBWay fit the SMD parts

Only four parts reflow — C3, R6, U1 and USB-C1 — and all four are on the top
side, so PCBWay can run single-sided SMT and leave the fifteen through-hole
parts to you. That takes the two hardest joints on the board (the SOT-23-6 and
the Type-C receptacle) off the bench without paying for full assembly.

`tools/pcbway_assembly.py` turns a gate package into the SMD-only upload pair,
deriving the split from the board rather than a hand-kept list:

```
python3 tools/pcbway_assembly.py nes_power_video.kicad_pcb pcbway_production/<timestamp>
```

Two things to know before ordering: **U1 is out of stock at both DigiKey and
Mouser** (112-day factory lead) while LCSC holds 44,000, so PCBWay must be
pointed at LCSC for it; and **USB-C1 is Hybrid, not SMD** — its four shell
stakes are through-hole pads on the paste layer, meant to reflow pin-in-paste
with the rest, not to be left dry. Full detail, including what to upload and
what not to, is in **[docs/pcbway-smd-assembly.md](./docs/pcbway-smd-assembly.md)**.

Key notes:
- D1 (zener/TVS): cathode (banded end) toward VBUS/+5V side. From v2 the
  silkscreen prints the value actually fitted, `1.5KE6.8A`; before that it
  printed the generic KiCad symbol name `1.5KExxA`, which is not orderable.
- Q1 (**2SA733**, PNP): flat side facing viewer, leads down = Emitter-Collector-Base, left to right.
  This replaces the 2SA1015/KSA1015, **both of which are end of life** (checked 2026-08-29): MCC's
  `2SA1015-GR-AP` is stocked at Mouser but flagged End of Life, and every onsemi `KSA1015` reads
  Obsolete on DigiKey, available only through Rochester Electronics' last-time-buy channel. The
  2SA733 is in current production, shares the E-C-B pin order exactly so it drops straight in, and is
  a better part for a video buffer: f_T 190 MHz typ against the 2SA1015's 80 MHz, C_ob 2–3 pF, P_C
  750 mW, with the same V_CEO −50 V / I_C −150 mA / V_EBO −5 V — so R2 still guards the base-emitter
  junction exactly as before. Buy the UTC `2SA733L-P-T92-B` from LCSC (**C5310429**, ~$0.035); rank P
  is hFE 200–400, which matches the ~46 µA base current measured on the bench, so the bias point does
  not move. DigiKey's Renesas 2SA733 is Rochester stock at $1.90 — same trap, different part.
- **Why not a 2N3906 or BC557?** Not for the reason you might assume. Electrically the 2N3906 is
  perfectly happy here — V_CEO −40 V, I_C −200 mA, f_T 250 MHz, V_EBO −5 V, hFE 100–300 at 10 mA,
  every figure with huge margin against a 5 V rail at ~9.3 mA. The problem is the middle pin. Per
  UTC's ordering tables, the 2N3906 is **E-B-C** and the 2SA733 is **E-C-B**: the 3906 puts *base* in
  the centre where this board wants *collector*. Turning the part around gives C-B-E — base is still
  in the middle, so no orientation fixes it and you would have to cross two leads. On a v3 layout the
  pin order is free and the 2N3906 becomes a fine choice; on this board it is not. Pin order is a
  manufacturer's choice rather than a standard, so check the datasheet of the exact brand you buy.
- R1 (220Ω): emitter load for Q1 — one end to +5V, the other to the Q1 emitter / C2 node. Not both ends to +5V. Lowered from 300Ω in v2 to raise the drive current: at the assumed ~1.3 V base, 300–330Ω supplies only ~6.2 mA at peak white against the ~6.7 mA the 150Ω load wants. Retune if the measured DC at J4 pin 1 differs from ~1.3 V.
- R2 (330Ω): series resistor in the video input line, between J4 pin 1 and Q1's base. See [Video input biasing](#video-input-biasing).
- **Trim all through-hole leads flush.** The board sits in the RF module slot with shielding immediately below it. Long clipped leads on the underside will short against the can — on the prototype this presented as an intermittent supply trip that only appeared when the board was moved.
- C2 (470µF): not 100µF. Into the 150Ω load, 100µF gives τ=15 ms against the 16.7 ms field period and tilts the picture top to bottom. 470µF gives τ=70 ms.
- F1 (polyfuse): sits with slight standoff above PCB by design — this is normal for radial-lead parts, not a defect.
  **No KiCad footprint exists for the Littelfuse RHEF series**, so F1 borrows `Fuse:Fuse_Bourns_MF-RG300`:
  pads 5.24 mm centre-to-centre with 1.01 mm drills. The RHEF200's 0.51 mm leads at 5.05 ±0.75 mm
  spacing fit that comfortably, but the Bourns device is rated 3.0 A/5.1 A and the silkscreen outline is
  *its* body — treat the outline as indicative, not as a clearance boundary. Drawing a true RHEF200
  footprint would move pad 2 by ~1.2 mm and force a re-route, so it is a v3 job, not a patch.
- USB-C1: GCT USB4970-00-A, SMD receptacle — power-only, no data lines. KiCad has no USB4970
  footprint, but GCT's USB4970 drawing specifies the same recommended land pattern as the USB4125
  (pad centres 1.00/3.04/5.50 mm, shell holes 8.64 × 3.80 mm apart), so
  `Connector_USB:USB_C_Receptacle_GCT_USB4125-xx-x` is the right footprint. Use the **plain** variant:
  USB4970-00-A takes the 1.00 mm shell stake, and `-0190` is the 1.90 mm stake part. Pad geometry is
  identical between the two, so this is a naming correction, not a layout change.
- U1 (TPS2553, SOT-23-6): pin 1 is IN, marked by the dot on the package. Pin order is IN, GND, EN down one side and OUT, ILIM, FAULT up the other. Order the plain TPS2553DBVR — the `-1` suffix is the latch-off variant, which would need a power cycle after every trip instead of retrying automatically.
- C3 (100nF, 0805): TI requires this as close to U1 pin 1 as the layout allows. It sits immediately left of U1.
- R6 (22k, 0805): sets the current limit — see the table above before substituting.

## Certification

This project is **OSHWA-certified open source hardware**, UID **[US002842](https://certification.oshwa.org/us002842.html)**.

The certification confirms that the design files, schematics, PCB layout, bill of
materials and documentation in this repository are published under an
OSI/FSF-approved open licence and are complete enough for someone else to study,
modify, manufacture and distribute the hardware. See the
[OSHWA certification directory entry](https://certification.oshwa.org/us002842.html)
for the registered details.

The certification mark above is
[`certification-mark-US002842-stacked.svg`](./certification-mark-US002842-stacked.svg),
issued by OSHWA for this UID. It applies to this design only — it is not
transferable to derivatives, which need their own certification.
